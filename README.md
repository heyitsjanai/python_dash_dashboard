# cs340
Here is an interactive dashboard created using Dash, Python, and MongoDB shell, submitted as Project Two for SNHU CS 340.

I am so proud to have debugged and created a fully functional dashboard web application. Building on prior knowledge from 
previous courses, I continued to write readable, maintanable code by implementing informational variable names, 
inline comments that are informative and helpful, and using 'print' statements that give users verification as to what
functions are being performed (or not). This helped me immensely when debugging, as many issues popped up along the way,
including callback errors (TypeError was the most common). Correctly naming variables helped in creating correct callback
functionality, as well as commenting out non-functional code as I went along, updating iteratively to solve issues.

Once again, I jumped in prematurely into the project and did not have a full understanding of Dash Core Components 
before beginning. I realize the importance of reading documentation, using the resources fully, and having a good grasp
on core concepts before beginning a project. This way, when the client makes requests, I can pull from the relevant
resources and understand how to execute the basic functions of what they are asking for before customizing it to meet
user criteria. In the future, I will create more pseudocode to fully map out how the Python methods will be used within
a database before trying to style and personalize the dashboard. Callback functions in Dash were also new to me, so going
forward, I have a better understanding on how to implement them.

Computer scientists break a big problem down into smaller, more solvable pieces to reach an end goal. I believe I did just 
that in this course. I had to read a lot of documentation on MongoDB, Dash, and Plotly, but luckily, my knowledge of Python 
is very solid. I am confident that if I were in a data analyst or data scientist position, I would be able to deliver an interactive,
informative dashboard like this one here.
